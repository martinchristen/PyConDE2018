# Processing Geodata using Python## Talk at PyCon.de 2018 [https://de.pycon.org/schedule/talks/processing-geodata-using-python/](https://de.pycon.org/schedule/talks/processing-geodata-using-python/)Presented by Prof. Martin Christen, martin.christen@fhnw.ch* Where: Room "Cubus" / "Kubus"* When:  **Thursday October 25, 2018,14:50 - 15:20**## ContentsThere is a large amount of Python modules available suitable for spatial data processing. In this talk, it is shown how to analyze, manipulate and visualize geospatial data by using open source modules. The following modules will be introduced:* Shapely - Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects* Fiona - The pythonic way to handle vector data* rasterio - The pythonic way to handle raster data* pyproj - transforming spatial reference systems* GeoPandas - Geospatial analysis* Folium - Creating maps## NotebookThe notebook is found in this repo
